Prerequisites for React Native
React Native start karne se pehle kuch concepts aur tools ka knowledge zaroori hai:

HTML & CSS – Basic markup aur styling ka concept samajhna zaroori hai.
JavaScript (ES6) – Functions, arrow functions, objects, arrays, and promises samajhne chahiye.
React Basics – State management, props, components (functional aur class-based), hooks ka use.
Node.js & npm/yarn – React Native ke dependencies install karne ke liye zaroori tools.
Git – Version control system ka basic knowledge helpful rahega.
Android Studio & Xcode – Mobile app ke native builds banane ke liye zaroori hain (Windows pe sirf Android Studio chahiye).

Niche Basic to Advanced Topics ka breakdown diya gaya hai jo React Native me expertise hasil karne ke liye zaroori hain:

Phase 1: Basics of React Native
Goal: Core React Native setup aur basic components ko samajhna.

Environment Setup:
Android Studio aur Xcode (for iOS) ka setup
Device/Emulator pe app run karna
Debugging tools (React Native Debugger, Flipper)

Core Components:
View, Text, Image, ScrollView, FlatList
TouchableOpacity, Button
StyleSheet usage aur inline styling

Flexbox Layout System:
justifyContent, alignItems, flexDirection
Spacing with padding aur margin

State Management (Basics):
useState() Hook
Props aur State ka difference
Props drilling ka concept

Phase 2: Navigation & Routing
Goal: Multi-screen apps banani aur data ko screens ke darmiyan share karna.

React Navigation Library:
Stack Navigator
Tab Navigator
Drawer Navigator

Passing Data Between Screens:
route aur navigation props se data pass karna

Deep Linking & Dynamic Links:
URL ke through specific screens open karna

Phase 3: State Management & Redux
Goal: Complex apps me state management karna efficiently.

Context API:

Middleware: Thunk / Saga:
Async operations Redux ke sath (API calls)

Phase 4: Networking & API Integration
Goal: Backend se data fetch karna aur render karna.

Fetching Data:
fetch() aur axios se API call karna
useEffect() ka use for lifecycle methods

Handling Forms and Inputs:
Controlled Components: TextInput ke sath useState
Form validation with libraries like Formik and Yup

Error Handling & Loading States:
Error ko gracefully handle karna
Loading spinners / skeleton loaders

Phase 5: Advanced UI & Animations
Goal: Smooth aur interactive user experience dena.

Custom Styling & Themes:
Global theming with React Native Paper / Styled Components

Animations:
Animated API aur LayoutAnimation
React Native Reanimated library for complex animations

Gesture Handling:
React Native Gesture Handler se swipe aur drag effects

Phase 6: Device Features & Native Modules
Goal: Device-specific features ko implement karna.

Permissions & Device Info:
react-native-permissions library se permissions handle karna

Using Device Features:
Camera & Image Picker: react-native-image-picker
Location services: react-native-geolocation-service
Push Notifications with Firebase

Integrating Native Modules (Java / Swift):
Platform-specific code likhna aur React Native me use karna

Phase 7: Performance Optimization & Testing
Goal: App ko fast aur bug-free banana.

Performance Optimization:
Memoization with React.memo, useCallback, useMemo
Lazy Loading & Code Splitting

Testing:
Unit Testing with Jest
Component Testing with React Native Testing Library

Crash Reporting & Analytics:
Firebase Crashlytics & Analytics ka integration

Phase 8: Building & Deploying the App
Goal: App ko production ready banana aur Play Store / App Store pe deploy karna.

App Signing & Building APK / AAB:
Release APK banani
Signing aur keystore setup karna

Publishing the App:
Google Play Store aur Apple App Store pe upload karna

CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Delivery):
GitHub Actions ya Fastlane ka use for automated deployment

Phase 9: Advanced Topics & Best Practices
Goal: React Native me professional expertise hasil karna.

Typescript with React Native:
Type-safe coding karna

Code Architecture & Design Patterns:
Atomic Design, MVVM Architecture

Monorepos & Modular Apps:
Nx or Lerna ka use for managing large codebases

Third-Party Libraries & SDKs:
Payment gateways (Stripe)
Social logins (Google, Facebook, etc.)
Resources for Learning React Native (Basic to Advanced)

Documentation:
React Native Official Docs
React Navigation

YouTube Channels:
Net Ninja, Traversy Media, Academind
Code with Mosh (for React/React Native basics)

Courses:
Udemy: React Native Bootcamps
Coursera: React Native with Expo

Books:
React Native in Action by Nader Dabit
Fullstack React Native

Tips for Success:
Practice Projects: Jo kuch seekh rahe ho, usko chhoti chhoti apps me apply karo.
GitHub Profile: Apne projects ko GitHub pe host karo to showcase your work.
Stay Updated: React Native rapidly evolve karta hai, so be active in communities (Reddit, Discord, Stack Overflow).
Contribute to Open Source: Open source libraries ke sath kaam karne se real-world experience milega.
Agar tum ek ek phase ko complete karte jaoge aur project pe apply karte rahoge, to React Native me expert banne ka safar easy aur productive hoga. Tumhari learning smooth ho aur har topic ka depth understanding mile!
Small Milestones Set Karo: Har phase ko todh kar weekly ya monthly goals bana lo, jisse progress measurable ho.

Agar tum sirf isi roadmap ko strictly follow karoge aur unnecessary cheezein avoid karoge, to tum bohot ache React Native developer ban jaoge. React Native seekhne ka koi shortcut nahi, lekin ek structured aur step-by-step learning tumhare liye fastest aur effective rahegi.
